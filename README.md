## Integrate with editors

Enhance your Nx experience by installing [Nx Console](https://nx.dev/nx-console) for your favorite editor. Nx Console
provides an interactive UI to view your projects, run tasks, generate code, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and
comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Start the application

Run `npx nx serve poke-api` to start the development server. Happy coding!

## Build for production

Run `npx nx build poke-api` to build the application. The build artifacts are stored in the output directory (e.g. `dist/` or `build/`), ready to be deployed.

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

Run localhost:
```
npx nx run poke-api:serve
```

Run Unit tests
```
npx nx run poke-api:test
```

Run e2e tests
